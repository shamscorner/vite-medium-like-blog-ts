### ðŸ‘‹ Hi Vuers!

If you are really into the [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) (Vite + Vue3 + Typescript + Pinia + auto import + layouts + pages + icons + pnpm + file based routing + pwa + windicss(tailwindcss) + icons + i18n + markdown + ssg + critical css, and many more) starter template created by [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) (Vue core team member) but want to use the [modular architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_pattern) instead of [monolithic architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application), then you can clone the following repo and use your own project. I have changed some of the setups in the [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) repo and created my own architecture ([modular approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_pattern)). I am loving it so far and have used some of my projects.

- [Github repository link](https://github.com/shamscorner/vitesse-stackter-clean-architect)
- [live demo](https://vite-vue3-clean-arch.netlify.app/)

### Quick Overview

First thing you will notice there are no `components/`, `pages/`, `stores/`, `styles/` folders under the `src/` folder. You will see,

- `common/`
- `orders/`
- `users/`

and that's it. Everything has been moved into the `common/` folder (global settings). The `orders/` and `users/` folders are more like modules ([modular architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_pattern)). In this project, I have made a demo order process using these two modules but in your case, you will delete everything other than the `common/` folder. You will add a new module whenever you need it without breaking any changes. The main advantage you can see is that you don't have to jump around different folders to implement a feature that is completely separate from other features ([separation of concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)). You can add the following folders in each module without any manual imports,

- `components/`
- `modules/`
- `pages/`
- `stores/`

I will highly recommend you to try [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) using [monolithic architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application) first. Then you can move to my repo https://github.com/shamscorner/vitesse-stackter-clean-architect when you feel comfortable.

Have fun! ðŸ™‚
